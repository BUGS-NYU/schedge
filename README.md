# Schedge
Schedge is an open source API to NYU's course catalog, geared at eventually helping
NYU students plan their courses easier and faster.

NYU Albert is really annoying to use, and so is the rest of NYU's course catalog
infrastructure. Our goal with this API is to make it easier for students to plan
out their schedules, and eventually to also do some of that for them.
