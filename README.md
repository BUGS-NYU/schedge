# Schedge
Schedge is an open source API to NYU's course catalog. Its goal is to help
NYU students plan their semesters' courses easier and faster.

NYU Albert is really annoying to use, and so is the rest of NYU's course catalog
infrastructure. Our goal with this API is to make it easier for students to plan
out their schedules, and eventually to also do some of that for them.

## NOTE: NYU removed the service that Schedge uses, so Schedge v1 has been deprecated, and will not have up-to-date data for semesters after Fall 2022.
The service that NYU replaced it with uses an entirely different data model, so I'll be releasing a version 2 of Schedge with breaking changes to update Schedge to the new data model.
