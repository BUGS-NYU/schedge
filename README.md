# Schedge
Schedge is an open source API to NYU's course catalog. Its goal is to help
NYU students plan their semesters' courses easier and faster.

NYU Albert is really annoying to use, and so is the rest of NYU's course catalog
infrastructure. My goal with this API is to make it easier for students to plan
out their schedules, and eventually to also do some of that for them.

## NOTE: The previous version of Schedge has been deprecated, and will not have up-to-date data for semesters after Fall 2022.
The service that Schedge v1 depended on was removed by NYU, and uses an entirely different data model,
so Schedge v2 (the current version) contains breaking changes.
